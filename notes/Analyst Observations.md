## Analyst Observations

- Multiple failed SSH login attempts were observed from a single IP address.
- Failed attempts targeted invalid users, indicating brute-force behavior.
- A successful login was detected shortly after failed attempts.
- Timeline analysis suggests credential compromise.
- This activity would warrant escalation and IP blocking in a production SOC.
