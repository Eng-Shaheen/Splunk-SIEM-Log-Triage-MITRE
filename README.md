# Splunk Log Triage Lab

## Overview
This project simulates a real-world SOC analyst workflow using Splunk SIEM.
The lab focuses on detecting, investigating, and triaging suspicious authentication activity.

The objective is to demonstrate hands-on experience with SIEM monitoring,
alert analysis, and incident investigation commonly performed in enterprise SOC environments.

## Lab Scenario
Multiple authentication attempts are observed from the same source IP.
The analyst investigates logs to determine whether the activity represents
a brute-force attack or unauthorized access attempt.

## Tools Used
- Splunk Enterprise
- Linux
- Sample authentication logs
- SIEM search and dashboards

## Workflow
1. Ingest authentication logs into Splunk
2. Search and filter suspicious events
3. Identify repeated failed login attempts
4. Correlate source IP and user activity
5. Perform alert triage and investigation
6. Document findings in an incident report

## SOC Relevance
- Log monitoring
- Alert triage
- Threat investigation
- Incident documentation
